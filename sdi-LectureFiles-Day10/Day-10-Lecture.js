    Create a function that accepts a username and password and then checks
    that against a list of data in the JSON to determine if the user exists
    and is allowed to login with the password provided.  The function should
    only return a string with the first name of the user if the username and
    password are correct.  It should return a string indicating failure if
    the input is wrong.  The code will then output that string.
